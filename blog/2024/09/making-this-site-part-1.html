		<h1>The Making of This Site Part 1: Let's Get Started</h1>
		<p>Date written: 10th Sep 2024</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>So, after daydreaming about it for literal years now, I have finally decided to create this site. From scratch. Like, with HTML and CSS and everything.</p>
		<p>At the time of typing this blog, here's how the site currently look like:</p>
		<img src="../../../images/2024/09/Screenshot 2024-09-10 205722.png" alt="The very barebone version of the Home page, with Windows built-in fonts. The site has light sepia background and yellow header text. Normal text and read links are near black while normal unread links are dark cyan."/>
		<p>It took like,, 2-3 hours? Probably could've done faster but I'm feeling too chill from listening to Christmas Jazz (while the outside is still 28‚ÑÉ.) Well, it's not like it's a race, and I still have plenty of things to work on this site.</p>
		<p>So far I've managed to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><s>Add basic contents to have a feel for the site.</s></li>
			<li><s>Ensure basic legibility concerns (sufficent contrast, proper margins.)</s></li>
		</ul>
		<p>What I currently want to add:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Web 1.0 inspired things (guestbooks, web circles,...) üåè</li>
			<li>Progressive and adaptive rendering for faster loading when I eventually have more media uploads.</li>
			<li>Tagging/filtering system.</li>
			<li>A proper yet still fast and minimal portfolio.</li>
			<li>Proper fallback codes for people who are somehow still running Internet Explorer on Windows XP (can't blame ya, XP's still the best Windows.)</li>
			<li>More pages, lots more pages.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I think that's all for now. Everything is currently pretty basic and I actually kinda content with it. Let's hope I don't get too carried away and start feature-creep this site.</p>
		<p>(<dfn>feature-creep</dfn> is the act of constantly moving the goal to add more features to a service, eventually bloating it and making it too complex to use.)</p>

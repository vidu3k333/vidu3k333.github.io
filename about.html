		<h1>I'm a born and raised Vietnamese guy with way too much interests.</h1>
		<p>Music producer, graphic designer, singer, author, blogger, tutor, waiter, caretaker, streamer, photographer, and shopkeeper.</p>
		<p>Those are all the jobs I was/is working.</p>
		<p>...I might be too much of a "Jack of all traits".</p>
		<p>The creative related ones are either freelancing job or staying purely as hobbies, for now at least.</p>

		<h2>FAQ</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Why can't you give your name and birthday? OPSEC is very much a real thing, always assume that every info you put online can be used against you.</li>
			<li>Are you okay? Mentally, definitely not. Physically, debatable.</li>
			<li>[something I posted] seems to be very personal, didn't you just answered that OPSEC is real? Just because I put things online doesn't mean it actually happened to me. People can tell lies on the Internet, you know?</li>
			<li>Favorite medias to consume? Christmas music.</li>
			<li>What do you actually do in your past times? Disassociate, I guess. Though I'm currently trying to work on this site more.</li>
